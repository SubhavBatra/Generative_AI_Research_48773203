Given an employer enters a compensation value in a job posting that falls below the configured minimum wage for the specified job location, when the form field loses focus or the posting is submitted, then an error message is displayed next to the field, and the posting cannot be published until corrected.

Given troubleshooting requires viewing the platform as a specific user (and the admin has the necessary permissions), when the administrator initiates an ""Impersonate User"" function from the console, then they can navigate the platform with the user's view and permissions (without accessing credentials), and all actions taken during impersonation are strictly logged for audit purposes.",,,,,,
